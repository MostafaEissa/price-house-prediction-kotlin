# House Price Prediction

This is a simple implementation of experimenting with different ML models using **Kotlin** using the [California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) dataset. 

The goal of this project is to **experiment with using Kotlin** for common data science tasks such as loading and manipulating dataframes, visualizing data and training classical machine learning models.
